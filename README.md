# GAN-and-WGAN
This is the Github repository for my own experimenation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Wasserstein GAN (WGANs). Through this self-project I taught myself how to develop neural network models using the Python language and acquainted myself with the Tensorflow and PyTorch frameworks. All the Jupyter Notebooks were run on Google Colab, an online computing platform with free GPU support. The user needs to mount their Google Drive at runtime in Colab in order to save the relevant computed quantities and output. 

The uploaded files are primarily for my own learning purposes and not optimized for readability. I am making the best effort to provide the relevant documentation as soon as possible.
